## Custom Commands

### How it works
Make a .cs file in the Commands directory.\
After making that, Restart Voczel or ask Voczel to "Reload Commands"

### Example
Close all Chrome processes:
```cs
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Speech.Synthesis;
class MyScript
{

    static SpeechSynthesizer speech = new SpeechSynthesizer();

    public void ExecuteAFunction()
    {

        Process[] chromeInstances = Process.GetProcessesByName("chrome");

        foreach (Process p in chromeInstances) {
            p.Kill();
        }
        speech.SpeakAsync("Closed all chrome windows for you.");
    }
}
```
